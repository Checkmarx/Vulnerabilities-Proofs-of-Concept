# Vulnerabilities Proofs-of-Concept

This repository hosts proofs-of-concept (PoC) exploit code for known vulnerabilities and security flaws. These PoCs are intended for educational, research, and testing purposes only. The goal is to assist the public in understanding and addressing identified vulnerabilities within their software, while showing that they are indeed exploitable.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year, followed by the corresponding CVE ids (or CxIds). Below is an overview of the structure:
```
/year/
    /CVE_id/
```

- **/year/**: Contains the PoCs organized by the year the vulnerabilities were discovered.
- **/CVE_id/**: PoC code for a specific CVE or CxId vulnerability.
