# POC for CVE-2022-39261 in PHP package `twig/twig`

Improper validation in `twig/twig` before versions 1.44.7, 2.15.3 and 3.4.3, allows the filesystem loader to read arbitrary files from outside the template's directory (Path traversal).

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install a vulnerable version of "twig/twig": ```composer require twig/twig:3.4.1```
2. From the "src" folder, start the website locally: ```php -S localhost:8000```
3. In the browser, go to ```http://localhost:8000```
4. You can see that the webpage displays the text ```You should not see this! It is vulnerable!```. This means it was able to load a file that was outside the templates directory.
