# CVE-2022-41404 - ini4j Infinite Recursion Vulnerability

This Proof of Concept demonstrates a vulnerability in ini4j library version 0.5.4 where circular references in INI files can cause infinite recursion.

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd 2022/CVE-2022-41404
```

## Running the PoC

1. Build the project:
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

2. Run the demonstration:
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="CVE202241404Demo"
```

## What to Expect

The PoC will:
1. Load a specially crafted INI file containing circular references
2. Attempt to read a value that triggers the infinite recursion
3. The program will hang due to the infinite recursion

## Technical Details

The vulnerability is triggered by circular references in the INI file. In this example:
- `dopey.weight` references `bashful.weight`
- `bashful.weight` references back to `dopey.weight`

This creates an infinite loop when trying to resolve the value.

## Affected Versions

- ini4j 0.5.4 and earlier
